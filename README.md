nGrpc is a sample game server using gRpc but in a different way. This server is ideal to be used with unity3d clients.
This repository is outcome of multiple game server project which I have done with gRpc and unity3d.
This repository is good for developers who want to learn about these topics:
  1- gRpc
  2- modular architecture
  3- test driven development (TDD)
  4- writing unit tests and integration tests and mocking
  5- inversion of control using dependency injection
