# nGrpc
nGrpc is a sample game server written with c# and .Net Core 3. This project is outcome of multiple online game projects which I have done with gRpc and unity3d.  

### nGrpc is using:
* grpc
* C#
* Postgresql
* .Net Core 3

This repository is good for developers who want to learn about these topics:
  * gRpc
  * modular architecture
  * test driven development (TDD)
  * writing unit tests and integration tests and mocking
  * inversion of control using dependency injection
